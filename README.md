# NGINX Server Profiler:

Track the user activity & errors logs on [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) using [Cron](https://crontab.guru/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). It sends the user logs as a user session when a user requests the Nginx server this will help to demonstrate managing authentication, initiating and concluding activities, and overseeing state transitions, Also it can also be beneficial for analyzing error events when diagnosing a problem. These logs are sent through Sendmail, a lightweight command line [SMTP](https://github.com/zehm/sendEmail) email client every minute by using a cron job. To provide flexibility & security I have used a Docker container to separate any process into its own Docker container, or one service per container. This is just a basic overview of the project and will upgraded with some advanced-level features in the future if you want to contribute or add some advanced-level functionality then fork out my git repository.
